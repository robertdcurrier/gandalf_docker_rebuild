GANDALF, the Global AUV Network and Data Archiving Long-term Storage Facility
(http://gandalf.gcoos.org) was conceived as an aid to AUV pilots operating
in the Gulf of Mexico.  GANDALF provides real-time vehicle positioning information
via a maps-based interface with dashboard display, plots of flight and science
sensors, Google Earth KMZ file generation and access to processed data files.

GANDALF is equipped with numerous layers that can be individually displayed on
the base map. Each layer’s transparency can be individually adjusted allowing for
‘mash-ups’ of layers.  Provided layers include CONUS NEXRAD, GOES visible and
GOES infrared satellite images, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll images
from the University of South Florida, sea surface heights from CCAR and NOAA
raster navigational charts.

In addition to the observational layers several model outputs are provided
including the Naval Research Lab’s ensemble of sea surface
velocity, sea surface temperature and sea surface elevation.   During a deployment
NetCDF files are created from uploaded glider data files and uploaded to the IOOS
Glider DAC.

GANDALF provides post-processing of mission data for AUV operators.
Binary data files and text log files are downloaded from operator’s servers
and publication quality plots are generated. Mission files are permanently
archived on the GANDALF server.

GANDALF provides a valuable service for AUV operators and is particularly useful to
glider operators that have little or no IT support.  GANDALF services are provided at
no cost to users: all that is needed is access to glider data files.
